Let's dive into the motivation and its working mechanism. For this we are referring the Andrew Huberman's lecture linked below.

## What is Dopamine?
- **Definition:** Dopamine, often referred to as a neuromodulator, plays a crucial role in coordinating neurons within the brain. It significantly influences feelings of pleasure, satisfaction, and motivation.
- **Low Dopamine State:** Instances of feeling lazy, lethargic, or apathetic often signify a state of low dopamine. Conversely, when we experience excitement or crave external stimuli, we are likely in a high dopamine state.
- **Neural Circuit Regulation:** Dopamine possesses the capability to either activate or deactivate neural circuits within the brain.
- **Impact on Emotions:** Dopamine not only prompts movement and encourages pursuit but also contributes to our emotional spectrum, leading to feelings of happiness or sadness.

## Working of Dopamine
- **Baseline Dopamine:** Dopamine operates within a baseline level, also known as the tonic level, which represents the average amount of dopamine circulating in our body.
- **Dopamine Peaks:** Peaks of dopamine, referred to as phasic levels, denote sudden increases or spikes in dopamine concentration.
* **When dopamine spikes up, the baseline level is reduced.** meaning the average amount of dopamine is reduced.
- **Baseline Reduction with Dopamine Spikes:** When dopamine experiences spikes, the baseline level decreases, indicating a reduction in the average amount of dopamine present.
- **Modes of Dopamine Release:** Dopamine can be released either locally between neurons or volumetrically, affecting a larger number of neurons simultaneously.
- **Quality of Experience:** The quality of an experience is not solely determined by the quantity of dopamine released but also by how much it varies compared to the baseline level.
- **Dependency on Previous Dopamine Levels:** The current quality of experience and dopamine levels are influenced by the dopamine levels experienced in the recent past.
- **Individual Differences in Baseline:** The baseline dopamine level varies among individuals.
- **Role in Adrenaline Production:** Dopamine also contributes to the synthesis of adrenaline, a key chemical involved in movement and excitement.

## Using Dopamine to Your Advantage

- **Activities and Substances:** Certain activities and substances have the ability to increase dopamine levels in the brain.

- **Coffee and Dopamine:** Coffee consumption can elevate dopamine levels to some extent, but mainly it makes the neurons more sensitive to dopamine, hence increasing the experience of dopamine effects.

- **Evolutionary Perspective:** From an evolutionary standpoint, dopamine played a crucial role in driving us to venture out and forage for survival. However, if dopamine levels remained elevated indefinitely, our motivation to forage would diminish. Hence, dopamine levels naturally decrease below baseline after a spike.

- **Limited Availability of Dopamine:** Dopamine release is constrained by the limited availability of this neurotransmitter. Once a significant amount is released, the pool of available dopamine is substantially reduced.

- **Replenishing Dopamine Levels:** To replenish dopamine levels, it's advisable to reduce exposure to high-dopamine activities. Moreover, it takes a considerable amount of time, ranging from days to months, to restore dopamine levels.

- **Intermittent Release for Healthy Levels:** Healthy dopamine levels are maintained through intermittent, unpredictable release patterns. Constant pursuit or expectation of high dopamine levels should be avoided.

- **Variation in Dopamine Levels:** Consistent, patterned high levels of dopamine should be discouraged, and efforts should be made to vary the levels of dopamine received.

- **Avoidance of Multiple High-Dopamine Activities:** Engaging in multiple high-dopamine activities simultaneously should be avoided to prevent overstimulation.

- **Cold Water Exposure:** Exposure to cold water gradually and steadily raises dopamine levels, and these elevated levels persist for an extended duration.

- **Perception of Time:** Dopamine influences our perception of time, making it challenging to engage in subsequent efforts after anticipating rewards.

- **Generating Dopamine Release from Hard Work:** Efforts should be directed towards generating dopamine release from the process of hard work itself rather than solely from the anticipation of rewards. This can be achieved by consciously perceiving hard work as rewarding, irrespective of immediate external rewards.

- **During Effort Dopamine Spike:** Rather than experiencing dopamine spikes before or after exertion, the aim should be to spike dopamine levels during the effort itself.
